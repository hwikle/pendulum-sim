Assignment: Exercise 15.24 Animation Pendulum Swing-Final Project
Authors: Henry Wikle and Kelly Whitchurch
Approximately 5 hours programming time. 
Files included: PendulumPane.Java, PendulumControl.Java, Screenshot.pdf
This program can be executed from any programming software such as Eclipse and NetBeans. (Or by use of Jar file)

This program creates a pendulum that will swing back and forth in the window pane by use of physics. This program allows
the pendulum to speed up upon pressing the up arrow on the keyboard and likewise decreases the speed when the down arrow 
is pressed. The pendulum can also be paused by holding down the mouse button and then will resume upon the mouse button 
being released. The algorithms that were used in this program include converting between polar and rectangular coordinates 
and applying torque to the pendulum by use of gravity to make it swing.The algorithms were optimized within the program and
utilized effectively to animate the program. 

This program uses APIE as the basis for the code. Abstraction is displayed in the PendulumControl class. The main animation
and speed control functions are hidden within this class and then accessed and used in the PendulumPane class. Polymorphism
and Inheritance are used by the inherited methods that were received from the inherited attributes of the imported javafx 
packages. Encapsulation is displayed by declaring the variables as private. This prevents any other class from accessing the
information.
